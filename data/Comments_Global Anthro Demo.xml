      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>This is how information is passed from one person or group to another.</p>
      <p>Information can have different levels of certainty:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>direct (eye-witness) knowledge</li>
        <li>second-hand but reliable information</li>
        <li>hearsay</li>
        <li>legend or fairy tale</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, disseminating information about people in different levels of society may be done in different ways.</p>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:1-1</span>
        <span>Luke's word here for “account” was used for a *narrative of many events, as distinct from a narrative of a single event, and was most characteristically (though certainly not only) applied to works of history. Writers compiling a work usually started with one main source and wove in secondary material from another source or sources. (Most scholars agree that Luke begins with Mark as his main source and weaves in other material, including “Q”). IVP Bacrground Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1.1-4</span>
        <span>In Luke's day the more sophisticated writers would often introduce their books with a piece of stylish prose written in the classical style. (Those with literary pretensions generally imitated the Greek of a much earlier period than was commonly spoken.) Luke's introduction here is superb in this regard. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:2-2</span>
        <span>“Handed down” was sometimes a technical term in the ancient world. *Disciples of *rabbis normally passed down first-generation traditions carefully. Oral storytellers were also adept at memorizing and passing on stories accurately. Because Luke writes while eyewitnesses are still alive, and because they were accorded a place of prominence in the early *church, we may be sure that his traditions are reliable. (Eyewitness sources were accepted as the best.) IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:3-4</span>
        <span>Literary introductions often specified the purpose of the work (e.g., in *Josephus's Against Apion: “to teach all who wish to know the truth” about the Jewish people); here Luke wishes to provide “exact information” (“exact truth”—NASB; “certainty” —NIV). It was proper for a good historian to check the data that had come to him. Books would often open with a dedication to the wealthy *patron who sponsored the writing project. (Luke-Acts is not just a private work; Luke's Gospel is within 3 percent of the length of Acts, both fitting the standard size of scroll for publication.) Theophilus, the name of the sponsor, was a common Jewish name. “Most excellent” could literally mark him as a member of a high class in Roman society (the equestrian order), although Luke may use the title only as a courtesy. Theophilus's desire for verification was reasonable in view of the many competing claims to religious truth in the Roman Empire. IVP Background Commentary</span>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 4:14-30</span>
        <span>Visiting *rabbis were often given opportunities to teach; but Nazareth, a village of sixteen hundred to two thousand inhabitants, already knew Jesus and would be less open to thinking about him in new ways. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 4:32-32</span>
        <span>Most teachers would try to expound the *law by explaining the proper way to translate it or by appealing to their legal or *narrative traditions; Jesus goes beyond such practices. IVP Background Commentary</span>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 4:38-44</span>

        <span>LUK 5:12-16</span>
        <span>It was nearly impossible to find a place to be alone in ancient towns, with their narrow streets and sometimes (often in poorer places like Egypt) twenty people living in the common one-room houses. Most blocks in Capernaum consisted of four homes facing a common courtyard. Villages were also often close together, though one could find a place alone if one arose early enough (most people arose at dawn). IVP Background Commentary</span>

        <bold>Research Suggestions</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Questions to ask when exploring how information is disseminated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How are different levels of certainty indicated when information is given?</li>
        <li>How are important life events announced?</li>
        <li>How is information about people in different levels of society communicated (ordinary person, respected teacher, royalty)?</li>
        <li>How is important information spread to others?</li>
        <li>What is the means of spreading credible information? </li>
        <li>When information is spread, what can happen to make it seem suspecious or not true?</li>

        <bold>Numerology (OCM 801)</bold>
      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Numerology is how people count and measure things, their beliefs about numbers (lucky, unlucky, etc.) and the symbolic use of numbers.  You need to learn about or think about the numbering and measuring system –or systems-  people use in your area. Or if you are a native speaker, to think about your systems. How do you count different kinds of things? This is the study of numeration. You also need to learn about the beliefs people may have about certain numbers, that they are lucky, unlucky, or otherwise symbolic. This is the study of numerology.</p>
      <p>Certain numbers can have symbolic and other important meaning in cultures. There are many uses of numbers and measure in Scripture. You can and should increase your understanding of translation issues in the area of Numbers and Measures and Numerology in advance of entering a language field project. Translating numbers without knowing their significance can miscommunicate the meaning, or lessen the impact of a Scripture passage. Scripture Use can be enhanced through appropriate use of numbering of Scripture products and their presentation. Knowledge of which numbers are good or bad can prevent miscommunication with the people around you.</p>

        <bold>Cereal Agriculture (OCM 243)</bold>
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The agricultural cycle is how a sociey organizes its activities associated with the production of food crops in a particular location. Whether families grow their own food, buy and barter for food grown by others, or do both, the agricultural cycle plays a key role in the formation of any society and its culture.</li>
        <li>The agricultural cycle is the seasonal round of activities associated with the production of food crops in a particular locale. Whether families grow their own food, buy and barter for food grown by others, or do both, the agricultural cycle plays a key role in the formation of any society and its culture.</li>
        <li>As you study the agricultural cycle in your locale, you will</li>
        <li>learn language and cultural patterns essential to your own adjustment to the basic rhythms of life and work in the locale.</li>
        <li>understand matters of basic importance to your neighbors: what they eat and how they obtain it.</li>
        <li>build a fund of knowledge in preparation for translating the many passages where there is literal or figurative use of agricultural themes in Scripture.</li>
        <li>Some scholars have suggested that “rubbing with their hands” (v.1) by extension constituted threshing, a forbidden category of work on the sabbath. Although the law of Moses was especially authoritative for Jewish legal experts, the *narratives of other parts of the *Old Testament sometimes illustrate principles of the *law's spirit taking precedence over its normal practice (e.g., 2 Chron 30:2-3). If Jesus could demonstrate his case from Scripture, his opponents technically could not prosecute him successfully, due to the variety of Palestinian Jewish views on how the sabbath was to be observed. IVP Background Commentary</li>
        <li>One needed to keep one's eyes on the path of the plow to keep its furrow from becoming crooked. The hand-held plow was light and wooden and often had an iron point. When Elijah found Elisha plowing, he called him to follow but allowed him first to bid farewell to his family (1 Kings 19:19-21). Jesus' call here is more radical than that of a radical prophet. IVP Background Commentary</li>
        <li>Study the agricultural cycle in your locale by observing and recording</li>
        <li>the seasons of the year and their typical weather patterns</li>
        <li>what crops are grown in what season</li>
        <li>the different work phases and requirements (burning, tilling, weeding, etc.)</li>
        <li>the particular requirements of the staple crops (such as rice, corn, millet,  wheat)</li>
        <li>the division of labor and composition of work groups (who does what part  of the work)</li>
        <li>harvest festivals and other social activities related to the agricultural cycle.</li>
        <li>how people handle both surplus crops, as well as shortfalls and famine.</li>

        <bold>Burial Practices and Funerals (OCM 764)</bold>
      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Burial, or cremation funeral practices vary from culture to culture.  They are important riturals for families and communities.  Because they often contain proscribed practices of things the family should do, they are times of intense family and social pressure. They are also times of crisis and transition and as such require family and / or comunity cooperation to honor and care for the desceased. </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        <bold>Application to Biblical source</bold>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
        <span>Interrupting a funeral was a blatant breach of Jewish law and custom; touching the bier exposed Jesus to a day's uncleanness (Num 19:21-22); touching the corpse exposed him to a week's uncleanness (cf. Num 5:2-3; 19:11-20). But in Jesus' case, the influence goes in the other direction. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
        <span>People customarily dropped whatever they were doing and joined in a funeral procession when it passed by. For a widow's only son to die before she did was considered extremely tragic; it also left her dependent on public charity for support unless she had other relatives of means. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
        <span> According to custom the bereaved mother would walk in front of the bier, so Jesus would meet her first. Philosophers often tried to console the bereaved by saying, “Do not grieve, for it will do no good.” Jesus' approach is entirely different: he removes the cause of bereavement (1 Kings 17:17-24).v(from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
        <span>By touching even the bier, a stretcher on which the body was borne (Jewish custom did not use a closed coffin), Jesus would contract corpse-uncleanness, the severest form of ritual impurity in Judaism. Only those closest to the deceased were expected to expose themselves to this impurity. The young man had not been dead long, because it was necessary to wash, anoint, wrap, mourn over and then bury the body as quickly as possible to avoid the stench of decomposition.(from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 9:57-62</span>
        <span>God had used several earlier prophets (Elijah and Elisha) to resuscitate the dead, but it was a rare miracle. The few pagan stories of resuscitations, especially from the third century A.D. (from Philostratus and *Apuleius), are later and not validated by eyewitnesses as the Gospel accounts are; they also often exhibit features missing here, such as reports from the underworld. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 8:46-48</span>
        <span>Jewish people generally believed that only teachers closest to God had supernatural knowledge. Jesus uses his supernatural knowledge to identify with the woman who had touched him—even though in the eyes of the public this would mean that he had contracted ritual uncleanness. Lest anyone be permitted to think that the healing had been accomplished by typical pagan magic, operating without Jesus' knowledge, he declares that it happened in response to “faith” (v. 48). (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 8:49-49</span>
        <span>Once an event had occurred, it was too late to pray for its reversal. For example, the *rabbis claimed that it was too late for one hearing a funeral procession to pray that it was not for a relative. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 8:50-56</span>
        <span>Several professional mourners were required at the funeral of even the poorest person; the funeral for a member of a prominent family like this one would have many mourners. Because bodies decomposed rapidly in Palestine, mourners had to be assembled as quickly as possible, and they had gathered before word even reached Jairus that his daughter had died. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 9:59-60</span>
        <span>Family members would not be outside talking with *rabbis during the mourning period, the week immediately following the death. The initial burial took place shortly after a person's decease, and would have already occurred by the time this man would be speaking with Jesus. But a year after the first burial, after the flesh had rotted off the bones, the son would return to rebury the bones in a special box in a slot in the tomb wall. Thus the son here could be asking for as much as a year's delay. One of an eldest son's most important responsibilities was his father's burial. Jesus' demand that the son place Jesus above this responsibility would thus sound like heresy: in Jewish tradition, honoring father and mother was one of the greatest commandments, and to follow Jesus in such a radical way would seem to break this commandment. IVP Biblical Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 16:22-23</span>
        <span>Jewish lore often speaks of the righteous being carried away by angels; Jesus spares his hearers the traditional corresponding image of the wicked being carried away by demons. Every person, no matter how poor, was to receive a burial, and not to be buried was seen as terrible (e.g., 1 Kings 14:13). But Lazarus, having neither relatives nor charitable *patron, did not receive one, whereas the rich man would have received great eulogies. True Israelites and especially martyrs were expected to share with Abraham in the world to come. The most honored seat in a banquet would be nearest the host, reclining in such a way that one's head was near his bosom. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 12:46</span>
        <span>The punishment of “cutting in pieces” is attested elsewhere in an earlier period in the pagan Greek East; Luke's readers, who would view themselves as more civilized, would no doubt find this detail horrifying. Taken literally, the subsequent banishment with unbelievers could mean that he was deprived of decent burial; but in the *parable it especially points to the Jewish doctrine of hell (*Gehinnom) for idolaters. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 23:52-53</span>
        <span>Condemned criminals did not normally receive such honorable burials; but exceptions seem to have been made on the intercession of well-to-do family or friends, as the skeleton of a crucified man buried in another aristocratic Jewish tomb of this period testifies. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 23:54-56</span>
        <span>Because bodies decomposed rapidly, mourners were allowed to anoint, wash and wrap the body in its shrouds even on the sabbath. More elaborate arrangements that these loyal women *disciples wish to bestow on Jesus, however, might wait until the sabbath (sundown Friday evening to sundown Saturday evening) has passed.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The easiest way to research burial / creamation funeral practices in your area is create a case study.  Start building the case study by asking someone in the community to tell you a story about a death in the community.  Ask them to describe:</li>
        <li>Who all is involved in the process?</li>
        <li>What happens to the body?</li>
        <li>What are the responsibilities of the deceased family? What do they do?</li>
        <li>How long does all of this take?  What is the timeline fof the story?</li>
        <li>What actions show respect / disrespect toward the deceased (and his family)</li>
        <li>What locations are important in the story?</li>
        <li>Are there any differences between a poor and rich man's funeral?</li>
        <li>What are the important things in the story? What are their roles?</li>

        <bold>Ethnometeorology (OCM 821)</bold>
      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>The weather is often a source of ideas and beliefs (especially about cause and effect). A group of people often share beliefs about the weather as part of their common cognitive culture, about weather phenomena, the seasonal round and climate, the earth, sun, moon, stars, eclipses and other unusual events, and the larger cosmos</p>
      <p>There are many references throughout the Scripture to weather. And there is probably no society where this is not a topic of great interest. Some of the ethno-meteorological references in Scripture are found in</p>
      <ul>
        <li>some of Jesus’ sayings and parables</li>
        <li>the description of the storm at sea in Acts</li>
        <li>prophetic passages of warning</li>

        <span>LUK 8:22-25</span>
        <span>Some ancient stories told of powerful individuals able to subdue even the forces of nature, but these were nearly always gods or, less commonly, heroes of the distant past. In Jewish tradition, the one who ruled the winds and sea was God himself (Ps 107:29), though a few pious men were reputed to be able to persuade him to send rain. The surprise of the *disciples at Jesus' power is thus easy to understand. Storms often rose suddenly on the lake called the Sea of Galilee; these fishermen had usually stayed closer to Capernaum and are unprepared for a squall this far from shore. The only place one could sleep in a small fishing boat with water pouring in from a storm would be on the elevated stern, where one could use the wooden or leather-covered helmsman's seat, or a pillow sometimes kept under that seat, as a cushion to rest one's head.</span>

Possibly the Sheckinah, or cloud of glory (see on Luke 1:35), which was the symbol of the Divine Presence (Exodus 33:9; 1 Kings 8:10).

      <p>Familiarize yourself with the concept of ethnometeorology and ethnometeorological passages in Scripture (see in Cumulative Index, p. 40 in this document).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which ones are about phenomena local to Israel and the Middle East and may need care in translating in an area where people have a different view and understanding of these things? What is your own society’s understanding of these things? Has it changed?</li>
        <li>Search out the language and ideas people in various categories in the society have about the cosmos, the seasons, weather and climate and their various cycles.</li>
        <li>What do people in your area think about such things as: why night and day happen, why the moon changes appearance, the movement of the stars and planets (and comets and meteors), weather changes like rain, frost, wind, and the round of the seasons? How do people explain unusual weather?</li>
        <li>What is thought to be the effect of weather on people? Of the objects in the sky on weather? Is the younger generation beginning to hold different views than their elders on these matters? What changes are occurring in their thinking, and where are the different ideas coming from?</li>

        <bold>Clothing (OCM 290)</bold>
      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Clothing involes the garmets and materials used to cover the body for utility, warmth and ornamentation.</p>
      <p>There are many general references in Scripture to clothing: garments, fine clothes, expensive clothes, as well as many references to particular items: tunic, robe, cloak, belt, sandals.</p>
      <p>Although clothing is first of all an everyday functional item of material culture, it carries a significant load of meaning for humans in all cultures, and so also in Scripture, where there are many, many references to clothing. Three types of usage regarding clothing in Scripture are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Literal: There are terms for specific items and types of clothing, their use, manufacture and repair, used descriptively without figurative or symbolic intent. When the angel tells Peter in prison to put on his cloak and sandals, it means just that. It is not figurative or symbolic.</li>
        <li>Figurative: There are clothing terms used figuratively or metaphorically. The Bible’s figurative language may turn out to work well in a receptor language, even though the hearers initially perceive it as odd or unconventional. For example, the expression “you are clothed with splendour” in Psalm 104 requires an inititial leap of imagination to make sense.</li>
        <li>Symbolic: There are clothing terms used to stand for larger truths or meanings. They may use such features as colors, the actions of putting on, taking off, and changing clothes, and the symbolic opposition, clothed vs. naked. Clothing is used symbolically in themes running from Genesis to Revelation, from the skin garments of Adam and Eve to the white robes of the saints.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:6</span>
        <span>The “swaddling clothes” were long cloth strips used to keep babies' limbs straight so they could grow properly (cf. Wisdom of Solomon 7:4). The IVP Background Commentary</span>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 5:33-39</span>
        <span>Jesus uses two familiar facts to make his point. Older clothes had already shrunk from washing. Wine could be kept in either jars or wineskins; wineskins, unlike jars, would stretch. Old wineskins had already been stretched to capacity by wine fermenting within them; if they were then filled with unfermented wine, it would likewise expand, and the old wineskins, already stretched to the limit, would break. Watered-down wine was drunk with meals. IVP Bible Background Commentary</span>

        <span>It was a breach of an elderly Jewish man's dignity to run, though familial love could take priority over dignity after a long absence (cf. Tobit 11:9—mother and son). Given the normal garb, the father would have to pull up his skirt to run. IVP Bible Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 15:21-22</span>
        <span>The best robe in the house would belong to the father himself. The ring would probably be a family signet ring— a symbol of reinstatement to sonship in a well-to-do house. Slaves did not normally wear sandals, though they carried and tied a master's sandals. The father is saying, “No, I won't receive you back as a servant. I'll receive you only as a son.” IVP Bible Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 15:19</span>
        <span>The rich man was clothed in fine purple clothes. This is a sign of his economic status.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 16:19</span>
        <span>Purple was an especially expensive form of apparel (cf. comment on Acts 16:14); the lifestyle Jesus describes here is one of ostentatious luxury. Although this man may have become rich by immoral means (as people often did), the only crime Jesus attributes to him is that he let Lazarus starve to death when he could have prevented it.

        <bold>Research Suggestions</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Study background information on clothing; also think about clothing in your own culture. The use of clothing in some form, even the bare minimum, is an important human universal. Find material on these topics</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People use clothing for both practical and symbolic purposes.</li>
        <li>They use it for warmth, for protection, to show modesty, ethnic identity, social status, or a spiritual condition. Examples?</li>
        <li>People may also choose their clothing in order to signal a break with their cultural traditions or social conventions. Examples?</li>
        <li>Many culture-origin myths include accounts of how people came to wear clothing. What does genesis say? What are some other accounts of the origin of clothing?</li>
        <li>Language related to clothing can reflect all these factors and have sociolinguistic implications as well. In English, what is the difference between clothes and garments?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note and record:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what items people wear</li>
        <li>men, women, boys, girls, adults, children, infants,</li>
        <li>what people of different statuses and roles wear</li>
        <li>elders, widows, richer/poorer, leaders, outsiders</li>
        <li>what people wear at life cycle changes/ceremonies, such as</li>
        <li>weddings, funerals, baptisms, initiations</li>
        <li>manufacture and care of clothes</li>

        <bold>Revelation and Divination (OCM 787)</bold>
      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Revelation can have many characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>from a positive source</li>
        <li>from a negative source</li>
        <li>predicting the future</li>
        <li>commenting on the present</li>
        <li>warning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding how a culture interprets events of revelation will enable you to avoid miscommunicating in some of the most crucial passages of Scripture.</p>

        <span>LUK 1:5-25</span>
        <span>While Zechariah is in the temple lighting the incense he is told by an angel that he will have a son.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:18</span>
        <span>Like Zechariah here, Abraham (Gen 15:8; cf. 17:17), Gideon (Judg 6:17, 36-40; 7:10-11) and others in the Old Testament (2 Kings 20:8; cf. Is 7:10-14) asked for signs in the face of astounding promises, but they were not punished. That Zechariah's sign should be harsher to him (1:20) suggests only that this revelation is much greater than those which preceded it. IVP Background Commentary</span>

        <span>Mary is told by an angel that she will have a son.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:19</span>
        <span>Although Judaism had developed quite a list of angelic names, the *New Testament mentions only the two who also appear in the Old Testament: Gabriel (Dan 8:16; 9:21) and Michael (Dan 10:13,21; 12:1). These became the two most popular angels in contemporary Jewish lore, in which Gabriel was sent on many divine missions. Jewish literature typically portrayed the chief angels as before God's throne. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:20-21</span>
        <span>Casting incense on the heated altar of incense normally took little time, after which the priest emerged immediately. The delay here may have troubled the crowds; perhaps they thought Zechariah had been disrespectful and struck dead, or that something else had gone wrong. If Zechariah's offering had failed, their prayers were also in jeopardy. IVP Background Commentary</span>

        <span>LUK 1:39-45</span>
        <span>"Like dancing, leaping was an expression of joy (e.g., Wisdom of Solomon 19:9). Jewish people recognized that the fetus was able to sense and respond to stimuli; while occasionally suggesting that the fetus's gender could be changed by prayer up until birth, some *rabbinic tradition also believed that infants could sin, sing and so forth in the womb. Some pagan stories also told of babies dancing in their mother's wombs or speaking in infancy, but pagans generally regarded these events as evil omens; here John's activity is instead a result of his prenatal sensitivity to the prophetic Spirit." IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 1:67-80</span>
        <span>n the *Old Testament only a fine line existed between inspired praise and *prophecy (e.g., 1 Sam 10:5-6; 1 Chron 25:1-3), and often, as in Psalms, one could move from one to the other (46:1, 10; 91:1, 14). 1:67.  The *Spirit of God was especially (though not exclusively) associated with prophecy in the Old Testament, and this perspective continued in various Jewish circles around the time of Jesus. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:8-20</span>
        <span>Angelic appearances, the revelation of God's glory and consequent fear among the humans present were common in the Old Testament when God was acting in history in special ways.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:10-12</span>
        <span>“Good news” could refer to the proclamation of God's salvation (Is 52:7), but pagans applied it also to celebrations of the cult of the emperor among all people in the supposedly worldwide empire. Particularly in celebration of his birthday (pagans publicly celebrated deities' birthdays), the emperor was hailed “Savior” and “Lord.” But Jesus' birth in a lowly manger distinguishes the true king from the Roman emperor, whose loyalists in Luke's day would have bristled at (and perhaps responded violently to) the implicit comparison. “Signs” are common in prophetic literature (e.g., Is 7:14; Ezek 12:11) and function as much to provoke and explain truth as to prove it. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK2:13:14</span>
        <span>This choir contrasts with the earthly choirs used in the worship of the emperor. The current emperor, Augustus, was praised for having inaugurated a worldwide peace. The inverted parallelism (God vs. people, and “in the highest” vs. “on earth”) suggests that “in the highest” means “among heaven's angelic hosts.” IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:25-26</span>
        <span>This encounter with Simeon no doubt occurs in the Court of Women. God's future intervention for Israel was described as “consolation” or “comfort” (cf., e.g., Is 49:13; 51:3; 52:9; 66:13). The “*Holy Spirit” was especially associated with *prophecy. On living to see God's *grace before dying, cf. Psalm 91:16, Tobit 10:13 and 11:9; sometimes in the Old Testament the righteous would be spared seeing disaster and the wicked would not experience good (e.g., 2 Kings 6:2; 22:20).</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:33-25</span>
        <span>Prophecies in Jewish and Greco-Roman tradition were often obscure, easier understood in hindsight than at the moment they were given. Simeon's words probably allude to the stumbling stone of Isaiah 8:14-15 and the anticipated *resurrection. The “sword” reflects either Mary suffering over Jesus' pain or her heart being bared, probably the former (a mother's grief can symbolize a son's suffering, e.g., Judg 5:28). IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:36-36</span>
        <span>Although the Old Testament did include prophetesses, they were much less prominent than male prophets in the Jewish tradition of this period. The name “Anna” (Tobit 1:9) is the Hebrew name “Hannah” (1 Sam 1:2).</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 2:37-38</span>
        <span>Jewish and Greco-Roman culture often viewed widows who never remarried as pious and faithful. Judith, a famous widow in Jewish tradition, was said to have lived as a widow till her death at 105. If one adds the two numbers given in the text here, seven and eighty-four (taking eighty-four as the length of Anna's widowhood rather than her age), and she was married at the common age of fourteen, one could see her as 105 also. IVP Background Commentary</span>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 3:15-15</span>
        <span>Slaves of high-status individuals often had higher status than free persons. A slave (unlike a *disciple, who also served a master) carried the master's sandals; John here claims that he is not worthy even to be Christ's slave. The prophets had predicted the outpouring of God's *Spirit on the righteous at the time when God established his *kingdom for Israel (Is 44:3; Ezek 39:29; Joel 2:28). They also decreed fire upon the wicked (Is 26:11; 65:15; 66:24; Jer 4:4; 15:14; etc.). In Matthew 3:11, the wicked are baptized, or immersed, in fire (3:10, 12), the righteous in the *Holy Spirit. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 3:16-17</span>
        <span>The *Old Testament prophets had declared that in the end time the righteous would be endowed with the *Holy Spirit and that the wicked would be burned with fire. The Jewish people generally viewed the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of *prophecy, and some circles viewed the Spirit as a force that purified God's people from unholiness. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 3 19-20</span>
        <span>John's preaching to Herod Antipas fits prophetic morality, but Herod and his advisers may view it as a political statement, especially given the political cost of Herod's illicit liaison with Herodias (see comment on Mk 6:17-20). Herod's nemesis, a Nabatean king, also found ethnic allies in Herod's subject territory of Perea, and Herod may have viewed John's preaching in that region (Jn 3:23) as especially damaging. In ancient Israel prophets normally enjoyed an immunity from persecution that was virtually unparalleled in the ancient Near East (prophets of other nations rarely denounced living kings; at most they suggested more funds for their temples). But some Israelite rulers did imprison (1 Kings 22:26-27; Jer 37—38) and seek to kill or silence them (1 Kings 13:4; 18:13; 19:2; 2 Kings 1:9; 6:31; 2 Chron 24:21; Jer 18:18, 23; 26:11, 20-23). John's costly stand prefigures Jesus' death at the hands of the authorities.</span>

      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 9:39-39</span>
        <span> The possessed person's lack of control over his own motor responses parallels examples of spirit possession in many cultures through history and is attested in anthropological studies of spirit possession today. Greek medical texts mention “foam” in connection with epileptic seizures, the symptoms of which are in this case (but not always—Mt 4:24) caused by demonic possession. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 9:40-41</span>
        <span>Jesus' response presupposes that he expected his *disciples to have enough faith to work miracles as he did. Some ancient  IVP Background CommentaryJewish teachers were seen as miracle workers, but not often did they expect their disciples to be able to do miracles also.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 9:42-43</span>
        <span>Exorcists normally tried to subdue demons by incantations invoking higher spirits, or by using smelly roots or pain-compliance techniques. Jesus here uses only his command, thereby showing his great authority. IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 4:14-30</span>
        <span>Jesus is revealing that the prophecy he just read has happened. "Immediacy (“today”; cf. 2:11; 19:5, 9; 23:43) is the initial key to the coming offense; the text Jesus reads is supposed to be fulfilled in the messianic era, and the inhabitants of Nazareth saw neither *Messiah nor messianic era before them. Because they lived only four miles from Sepphoris, they were well aware of how the Romans had destroyed that Galilean capital after a messianic-style revolt in A.D. 6; that this region was thereafter cautious about messianic announcements is clear from the fact that the rebuilt Sepphoris did not join in the later revolt of A.D. 66. Writers of the *Dead Sea Scrolls, who believed that they lived on the verge of the end time, often stressed the immediacy of biblical *prophecies, applying descriptions of Nahum, Habakkuk and others to their own day. Interpreting the Bible this way was thus not in itself offensive to first-century Palestinian Jews; the offense was implying that the end time had arrived in Jesus' own ministry." IVP Background Commentary</span>
      </p>
      <p class="scrtext">
        <span>LUK 9:18-19</span>
        <span>God revealed Jesus' true identity to Peter. "Because many Palestinian Jews believed that prophets in the *Old Testament sense had ceased, ranking Jesus among the prophets would have been radical—but it was not radical enough to grasp his true identity." IVP Background Commentary</span>

        <bold>Research Suggestions</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Questions to ask when researching revelation and divination:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the different sources of revelation? How is revelation revealed? What happens?  Who is a part of the process?</li>
        <li>By what means does knowledge from outside our realm come to humans?</li>
        <li>What actions are to be taken when a revelation is received?</li>
        <li>How does one determine the source of a revelation?</li>
        <li>Is all revelation to be trusted? What makes a revelation trustworthy?</li>
        <li>What makes revelation auspicious?</li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>Description</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Kinship refers to those relationships that people have with one another on the basis of</p>
      <ul>
        <li>consanguinity (relationships through descent or 'blood'), both lineal (direct descent line) and collateral (side line but common ancestor)</li>
        <li>affinity (relationships through marriage)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are generally the most important kin relationships for people and societies everywhere. Although kinship is a human universal, kinship systems and terminologies vary from locale to locale. They also change over time. Culture contact is a chief agent of change.</p>

        <span>Lk 1:26-38</span>
        <span>Joseph is Mary's husband; Joseph was of David's line,  Jesus would be his legal son, sp Jesus could qualify as belonging to David's royal house.</span>

        <span>The study of kinship and kin groups enables you to</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>understand and empathize with the relationships that matter most to people in your locale.</li>
        <li>prepare for translating and checking the many literal and figurative kinship topics and themes in Scripture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <bold>Research Suggestions</bold>
      </p>
      <p>Kinship is one of the more systematic and structured areas of human social life. Important topics for kinship study are</p>
      <ul>
        <li>kinds of kin groups</li>
        <li>kinship terminologies</li>
        <li>right ways of speaking of ancestors and reciting family genealogies, royal genealogies</li>
        <li>kin roles and their expected behaviors</li>
        <li>fictive kin, or people who are called by kin terms even though they are not 'really' related.</li>
        <li>causes and outcomes of conflict between kin and kin groups, and</li>
        <li>changes in kin-related language and behavior resulting from culture contact</li>
